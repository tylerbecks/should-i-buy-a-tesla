# Plan

## End Result Overview

The goal is to create a comprehensive analysis that identifies which Tesla model (new or used) will result in the least financial loss after one year of ownership, considering factors like purchase price, depreciation, mileage, and tax credits. The final deliverable will include:

Interactive Dashboard or Report:

Visual comparisons of new and used Tesla models.
Depreciation curves based on mileage and age.
Net cost calculations after factoring in tax credits.
Filters to adjust parameters like annual mileage.
Data Insights:

Tables listing all Tesla models with prices, mileage, and other relevant details.
Calculated depreciation rates for each model.
Recommendations on the optimal model and purchase option.
Recommendations Summary:

Clear guidance on whether to buy new or used.
Ideal mileage range for used cars to minimize depreciation.
Expected financial loss after one year for each option.
Methodology Documentation:

Explanation of data collection and analysis methods.
Assumptions made during calculations.

## Tech Stack Proposal

To achieve the above, we'll need tools for web scraping, data analysis, and visualization. Here's the proposed tech stack:

Programming Language:

Python: Widely used for web scraping and data analysis.
Web Scraping Tools:

Requests: To send HTTP requests to web pages.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting data.
Selenium: If the website uses JavaScript to load content dynamically.
Data Storage and Processing:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
SQLite or CSV Files: To store the scraped data.
Data Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating static graphs.
Plotly or Bokeh: For interactive visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive analysis environment.
Optional Dashboard Frameworks:

Streamlit or Dash: To build an interactive web dashboard if needed.
Development Environment:

Anaconda Distribution: Comes with most of the required packages.
Visual Studio Code or PyCharm: As the code editor.

## Implementation Plan

1. Define Objectives and Data Requirements:
   List the specific data points to scrape (e.g., model, year, price, mileage).
   Identify URLs and website structures for new and used Tesla listings.
   Ensure compliance with Tesla's terms of service regarding web scraping.

2. Set Up Environment:
   Install Python and necessary libraries.
   Configure the development environment.

3. Web Scraping Development:
   Step 1: Write a script to scrape new Tesla models, capturing prices and features.
   Step 2: Develop a scraper for used Tesla listings, including mileage data.
   Step 3: Handle pagination and dynamic content loading if present.

4. Data Cleaning and Storage:
   Clean the collected data (handle missing values, correct data types).
   Store data in a structured format for analysis (e.g., CSV or SQLite).

5. Data Analysis:
   Calculate depreciation rates based on mileage and age.
   Incorporate tax credits into the cost calculations.
   Estimate the expected resale value after one year.

6. Visualization and Reporting:
   Create graphs and charts to visualize depreciation and cost comparisons.
   Develop an interactive dashboard if desired.
   Compile findings into a report with visuals and recommendations.

7. Review and Adjustments:
   Validate the analysis results.
   Make adjustments based on any new insights or data.

8. Final Deliverables:
   Provide the complete dataset, analysis code, and final report/dashboard.
   Include documentation and instructions for future updates.
